    Many "buzzwords" are actually useful, in that they name concepts that were previously unnamed. And then, there is "thought leadership". Yuck.

    Maven, maverick, guru - really anything that has been adhered to the title of social marketing managers. We prefer Social Ninja, thanks.

    Viral. It's been so overused that it no longer has real meaning. We need a new word that packs a punch & hasn't been run into the ground.

    "H2H" or anything with "human" in the phrase. Advertising should always connect with people.

    Clickbait in general. You won't believe the simple reasons why I hate all clickbait headlines with a passion (number 11 will shock you!)
