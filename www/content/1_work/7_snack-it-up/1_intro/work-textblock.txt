Subhead: Fixing snacking

----

Text: Kids prefer cookies to fruit, and that's hard to change. So when ChildObesity180 asked us to create a campaign to promote healthy snacks, we set out to redefine what snacking should be, replacing the junk that sneaks into afterschool programs with fresh produce.

The result is SnackItUp, a multi-media campaign aimed at getting coaches, troop leaders, and parents to change what snacking means.
