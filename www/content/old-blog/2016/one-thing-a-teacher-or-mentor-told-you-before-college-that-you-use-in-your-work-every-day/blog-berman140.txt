    "Be open-minded." There is often a better way of approaching any problem. Don't shut yourself off from it.

    My first tennis coach taught me to never give up. I love a challenge. There's nothing better than achieving a goal I've set for myself.

    I didn't learn anything before college. My college mentor, however, told me to "never play leapfrog with a unicorn." She had a good point.

    "It's not about you." I learned that the only way to make anything happen is to see it from the other's POV. Persuasion begins with empathy.

    "Draw what you see, not what you think you see." A reminder that objectivity rarely exists and more rarely matters in design and persuasion.
