Elementary schools generally attract families with parents who attended a similar school. Private school parents tend to send their kids to private schools, and likewise for religious and public schools. The Rashi School, a reform Jewish day school founded less than 30 years ago, has a relatively small number of alumni parents, nowhere near enough to fill their classrooms. Where would students come from?

Our audience research led to the realization that the attraction of Rashi was in getting parents to consider the value of a values-based education. The Rashi School offers a unique alternative to public schools, with a curriculum of inter-related courses, differentiated instruction focused students’ varied learning strengths, and ethical values at the center of everything.
