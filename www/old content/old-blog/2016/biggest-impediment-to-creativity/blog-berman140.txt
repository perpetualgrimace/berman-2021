    Nothing kills creativity like fear. Fear of an angry boss or client, fear of failure, fear of ridicule. Itâ€™s my job to make it safe to try.

    Falling in love with a good idea. It's tempting to rush into editing and refining, but the only way to get to great is to push past good.

    Not taking time to step away from the thing I'm working on. I need to take a break, breathe, do anything else and clear my mind.

    For me, it's a lack of limits. When anything is possible, it's impossible to pick a direction.

    Close-mindedness. To be creative, I need to be open to new ideas and concepts. I can't do that if I'm too stuck in my ways.
