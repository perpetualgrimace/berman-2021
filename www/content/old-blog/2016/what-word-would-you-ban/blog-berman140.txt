    Here’s a fun game: Find a marketing campaign that *doesn’t* use the word "awesome". Time to kill it. (Also, http://bit.ly/1t3Wjwy)

    "Just" needs to die. It's too often used to belittle the effort of another person, as in "I just need you to copy this dictionary by EOD."

    I would kill off the word 'normal'. Because there is no such thing as normal. Your normal is always someone else's weird.

    I'm literally over the word "literally." It's been overused to the point that it doesn't even have a real meaning anymore.

    I would remove the word "anonymous." It's the only word that gives away my old speech disorder. I'm living "The King's Speech" 24/7.
