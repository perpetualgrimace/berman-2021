Text: Our website for GRIT was an interactive playground as well as a resource center. Kids and activity leaders could share whatever is their personal GRIT — what goal keeps them motivated to make the right decisions — directly through the website, or via Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, and see it populate on the website in real time.
