As far as we know, Jeff is the only creative director in the U.S. who studied astrophysics. After discovering what astrophysicists actually do, Jeff left the University of Chicago for an advertising job at Leo Burnett Company.

Jeff worked at Ogilvy & Mather (in New York) and Mullen (in Massachusetts) in a variety of account management and creative positions, before starting Berman in 2002.

Jeff still plays some bass and still rides his longboard, even though the neighborhood moms wish he wouldn’t.
