## Have you seen your brand?

Some people think of their brand as something they can touch or hold or put on a shelf. But brands exist only inside the heads of the people they're trying to influence. If those people aren't thinking of them, they don't have much of a brand.

Brand development is working to grow that space inside people's heads with your label on it. So it stands to reason that every place where people encounter your brand can either add to or subtract from the power of it.

### Why you want a singular brand identity

The point of developing a brand identity is to distinguish your company from among the alternatives available to your customers and prospects. Your brand — beginning with the name and the logo — should give people an idea why they should care about you.

Once you have a clear and compelling identity based upon the the core truth at the heart of your company, all the other touchpoints where you reach your users — all your marketing, event-based materials, advertising, packaging — become easier to create and more effective.

Your brand identity has the power to set you above your competition, if you can find someone to create it who will work to understand the challenges of your market and build your identity around your broad marketing and business goals. Someone like (link: about/people text: us).

#### True
The secret ingredient to compelling communication is truth. You can't build a business misrepresenting yourself to your customers. Truth is magic.

#### Outstanding
You want to literally stand out from the alternatives. And, if you're doing it right, you will distinguish yourself based upon a core truth that has meaning to your audience.

#### Relevant
Your brand had better be based upon something meaningful to your audience. If it's not, pick another audience or find something else to be.

#### Consistent
When your message and design reinforce your brand at every touchpoint, you can build a compelling brand a lot faster and with less money than if you're wishy-washy with it.
