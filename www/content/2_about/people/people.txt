## It all comes down to people

Beyond the quality of our work and the business results, it's the holistic experience of working with us that our clients remember and value. We never hide our people behind metrics or methods. Of course systems contribute to results, but people manage them, leave their mark on them, and give them a soul.

However many case studies or awards an agency rolls out at the start of a client engagement, the success of the business relationship ultimately comes down to people. There will never be a product or process that replaces the human element in a service business. People listen, create, and endeavor. People make things happen. And we have the best ones.

We must not forget that it is not a thing that lends significance to a moment; it is the moment that lends significance to things.
