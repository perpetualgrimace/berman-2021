It’s hard to be the dad, and it’s harder to be the dad who’s also trying to make a startup happen. You’re trying to make real your vision of the future and get others to buy into it, all while managing often out-of-control egos, working through a to-do list that never gets done, and making it all look nice to outsiders. And then there’s your job.

So, whether it’s you or some dad you care about, we offer the Fathers Day Gift Guide for the Startup Dad.


- $ = under $50
- $$ = under $100
- $$$ = sky’s the limit

## Something to make long days a little easier

6+ years ago, we decided to make what some people say was an imprudent investment in these chairs. Since then, we’ve spent more than 10,000 hours sitting on them, which gives us the right to endorse them. If you want to shop around, Wired wrote a (link: http://www.wired.com/2013/06/office-chair-gallery/ text: review) of six high-end desk chairs.



## Something to help with the business

### (link: http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/ text: **Switch**) $

Here at Berman, we specialize in changing how people think, but it’s really, really hard. This book by the Heath Brothers (Remember (link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400064287?ie=UTF8&tag=matost-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400064287 text: Made to Stick)?) is all about how to make change happen. And if there’s one person who knows how hard that is, it’s a Startup Dad.

We know lots of Startup Dads aren’t into following rules, but we also know that systems and processes are key to startup success. Maybe we ought to listen to this ruler more.

Timing is key in any business and at startups it seems to move at lightspeed. Keep him punctual and appeal to his analytical side with this beautiful watch-meets-fitness tracker by Withings.

### (link: http://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/boom text: **Ultimate Ears Boom**) $$$

(link: http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-speakers/ultimate-ears-boom-1291303/review text: Techradar.com) named the UE Boom Bluetooth speaker one of the most functional, highest quality units out there, and our founder’s son has one, so we can vouch for it. It’s nearly indestructible, sounds great, comes with an app full of bonus features, and in not quite a million fun color combinations.


## Something to show he knows it’s partly about show
(image: happy-socks.png)
### (link: http://www.happysocks.com/us/argyle-gift-box-for-men-with-4-pairs-socks-in-green.html text: **Happy Socks Gift Box**) $

Men don’t wear much jewelry. But they do wear socks. These add some energy to any guy’s wardrobe, and with men’s pants (link: http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/fashion-puts-men-in-a-tight-spot-with-pants-that-keep-shrinking/2014/06/24/aee7c8a0-f728-11e3-a606-946fd632f9f1_story.html text: going shorter than ever), good socks can add that certain je ne sais quoi.

This bespoke shirt service by Original Stitch is a fine way for any Startup Dad to distinguish himself. Their gift card gives him the power to customize his own shirt, from fit to color to pattern.

## Something that keeps on giving until next Fathers Day

(image: counterculture-coffee.png)
### (link: https://counterculturecoffee.com/store/subscriptions text: **Counterculture Coffee Subscription**) $

Did we mention that small businesses run on caffeine? Gift him roasted-to-order, organic coffee from Counterculture to make each morning a little more energized.

(image: massage.png)
### (link: http://www.massageenvy.com/membership.aspx text: **Massage Envy Membership**) $$

A massage once a month sounds like something in which no reasonable dad should indulge. But when you chalk it up to $60 for monthly stress-knot removal, it seems like a pretty smart investment. And when he says he can’t go to lunch because it’s Massage Monday, he’ll be the envy of his team.

(image: tasters-club.png)
### (link: https://www.tastersclub.com/ text: **Taster’s Club Subscription**) $$

Yes, he probably needs a drink, if not this moment, sometime soon. A nice whiskey, rum, or tequila subscription through Taster’s Club solves that problem in a fresh way each month.

(image: mantry.png)
### (link: https://mantry.com/gifts/three-month/ text: **Mantry Artisan Food Subscription**) $$$

Does his startup offer bowls full of artisan snack foods? Not until the next tranche of funding comes through? Well, here’s a way to tide him over until then.


## Something to remind him of home

### (link: http://www.amazon.com/Reasons-My-Kid-Is-Crying/dp/0804139830/ref=comopi-20 text: **Reasons My Kid is Crying**) $

If there’s anything that will make a Dad happy his work requires him to periodically leave the house, it’s this book.

(image: wooden.png)
### (link: http://shop.brooklynmakers.com/collections/toys/products/diy-wooden-dolls-kit text: **DIY wooden family figurines**) $$

Brings a whole new meaning to “bring your kid to work day”.

(image: hippopota.png)
### (link: http://www.hippopota.com/Hippopota.html text: **Hippopota art piece**) $$$

Christian Jaillite created photography project Hippopota to document the objects your family cherishes most. You send him, for example, your kid’s (maybe formerly) favorite stuffed animal. He photographs it in ultra-high def against a modern white background, gallery mounts it, and sends it back to you. And you get a beautiful, comtemporary, gallery-worthy art piece for the home or office.


##Something for his desk that will have people wondering what makes him so cool
(image: triada.png)
### (link: http://www.poketo.com/collections/kids-alpha-desc/products/triada-blocks text: **Triada Blocks**) $

Imaginative play doesn’t have to be limited to the kids. Here’s some desk art that’s great for a mental breather.

It doesn’t get any more quintessential than a (link: https://store.moleskine.com/usa/notebooks/notebooks/hard-cover-coloured-notebook/p2?lang=en-us&ic=wwsk7w%3D%3D&vid=7 text: Moleskine notebook). We love them here at Berman. A Moleskine bag makes for tasteful, well-designed utility, big enough to hold his everyday devices, and beats the pants off of a briefcase.


##Something the whole office can appreciate
(image: sox.png)
### (link: http://www.topps.com/carlton-fisk-heritage-vintage-sign.html text: **Vintage metal Sox player sign**) $

We are in Boston, after all.

(image: speedbag.png)
### (link: https://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod640025 text: **Vintage leather speed bag**) $$

Sometimes, startup life makes a dad want to punch things. This provides an alternative to his coworkers.

(image: stendig.png)
### (link: http://www.stendigcalendar.com/Stendig_Calendar/Welcome.html text: **Stendig calendar**) $$$

“Design isn’t how it looks. It’s how it works,” said Steve Jobs. The Stendig calendar is, not coincidentally, the most functional calendar we’ve found (aside from our own handmade one — stop by and see).


##Something to brag about your craftiness

(image: daddy-and-me-book.png)
### (link: https://pinholepress.com/products/daddy-me-memory-book-5-20031/ text: **Daddy and me board book**) $

Low tech? Yes. Powerfully touching? Also yes. This is a great way to remind him of all the reasons he’s a great dad.

(image: tieclip.png)
### (link: http://lovelyindeed.com/make-and-give-diy-stamped-leather-tie-clip/ text: **DIY leather tie clip**) $

You know what’s great about do-it-yourself things made up of words? You can write anything you want on there. Anything. Like your kids’ names. Or the place where you went skinny dipping after making love on a blanket in the sunshine, for instance.


##Something to keep him sharp

(image: memory.png)
### (link: https://pinholepress.com/products/memory-game-27-1-0-01/ text: **Custom memory game**) $

This customizable family photo memory game is something he can do at home with the kids, or keep at work as a Solitaire alternative.

### (link: http://www.amazon.com/Dads-Book-Awesome-Science-Experiments/dp/1440570779/ref=comopi-20 text: **Dad’s Book of Awesome Science Experiments**) $

For the healthcare or biotech Startup Dad. Something to do with your kid(s) and maybe even a way to explain what happens at work.

(image: bike-helmet.png)
### (link: https://www.hatch.co/products/16300-custom-hand-painted-one-of-a-kind-bike-helmets#/ text: **Custom, hand-painted bike helmet**) $$$

We don’t know why, but cycling and startups go together like beards and microbrews. These one-of-a-kind hand-painted helmets are so beautiful, they’ll make up for his nerd backpack and rolled-up pants. Mostly.

### (link: http://revolights.com/ text: **Revolights bike tire lights**) $$$

See above comment about bikes and startups. Another way to keep him safe in style.
