Text: Advertising is so much better when it focuses on the audience. (link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT3R9_ZjXXs text: These Zales ads) are the only jewelry commericals that appeal to guys, focused on why they buy jewelry. Making it about the moment when the reaction happens and setting the whole thing to that great Black Keys riff makes the Zales campaign the only jewelry advertising that has a prayer of being seen by any conscious man with a remote in his hand. Hats off to GSD&amp;M.
