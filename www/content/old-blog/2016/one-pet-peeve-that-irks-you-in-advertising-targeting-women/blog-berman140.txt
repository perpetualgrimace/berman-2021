    Too often, women are homogenized and marketing falls into the "make it pink" trap. Messaging to women should be as diverse as women are.

    Regular women are funny too. According to commercials, either you're girly, or a big name comic. Tina Fey can only endorse so many things.

    Our roles have evolved, so why do cleaning product commercials still primarily target women? We should be portrayed in a more aspirational way.

    Why do shaving ads feature hairless women? Time to show how products work with models whoâ€™ve gone a day or so without shaving their legs.
