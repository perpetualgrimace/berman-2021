## Laying the groundwork

Using (link: about/method text: Applied Empathy), we uncover the core truth of the brand and connect it with the deepest concerns of the audience. The resulting Strategic Platform performs two essential jobs:

1. **It serves as a guide in the development of the work.**
By providing a clear picture of where the audience is now and how we aim to influence them, the Strategic Platform clarifies business and communications goals from the start.

2. **It provides an objective measure for how well the work can be expected to perform.**
The Strategic Platform gives us a clear lense through which to judge the value of messaging and design. It saves us from decisions based on purely subjective reactions to design and messaging.

The Strategic Platform puts marketing at the service of your business objectives, accelerates your sales cycle, and lays the foundation for growth.
