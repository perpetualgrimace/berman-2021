Erin Eby: This is the most idiotic ad I've seen in a long time.
    
Jeff Berman: 
So I find this execution, and everything that aerie does, strategically interesting. Their audience is young teen girls, right? Everything they are doing is about helping girls feel like they are attractive as they are. I think they are going for an empowering message, which is smart for them. I'm curious to know where you think differently.
    
Erin Eby:
"This stunning, stereotypically beautiful woman shot in perfect lighting by a professional photographer, and dressed by a professional stylist, and surrounded by kittens doesn't need retouching, and neither do you, even though you're probably a little lopsided, darker, covered with pimples, and 50lbs heavier. And also not rich and famous."
    
It comes across as "aerie is the brand for perfect, skinny, gorgeous white girls who are naturally like that, and need no help from makeup or retouching."
It's a total executional botch of a good strategy.
    
They were aiming for Dove for teens, and hit on Abercrombie with less skin showing.
    
Jeff Berman:
Wow, I love working with you. I am humbled at the accuracy of your insight. 
I can imagine the series of meetings that resulted in this. The people responsible for the image clearly don't take the strategy seriously, and slid into their defaults. 

It's a shame because it's a good idea for teen girls, even if it is derived from Dove. 

Erin Eby:
I agree. I'm totally bummed out by how bad this is. I almost want to blog about it but I don't know if that's smart.
    
Jeff Berman:
I love that idea. Of course you should blog about it. In fact, I want to do a regular series of blogs on ads that should have been good, but missed. I don’t think ticking off the agency that did this is too great a risk.
    
Erin Eby:
This is just such an enormous flop, that it makes me angry. Instead of inspiring girls (and I have one now, so this makes me angrier), it's causing them to be even MORE insecure.
    
"What you mean you need makeup to look this perfect?"
    
Jeff Berman:
Well, not every girl can go around decorated with kittens every day.
    
Erin Eby:
The better campaign is to show real girls in aerie clothes and starting a campaign that says #noretouchingneeded or #cantretouchthis
    
Encourage real girls to be confident as they are. Teach them NOT to compare themselves with the Emma Roberts' of the world.
    
Jeff Berman:
I love that. You should write it.
    
I think the (link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/aerie-unretouched-ads-photos_n_4618139.html text: original executions) did a better job living up to the strategy. 

Erin Eby:
Because we all knew an Emma Roberts growing up. And the ad is right. She doesn't need retouching because she is f-ing perfect. We can't all be Emma Roberts. But we can be who we are.
    
Jeff Berman:
You are so spot on with this. It takes the phrase “Doesn’t need retouching” and turns it into a slam. Because clearly, dear girl reading this ad, you need some help.
    
Erin Eby:
It's that line in combination with using one of the most beautiful young women in Hollywood right now.
    
It forces the reader to compare themselves to her, which is impossible.
    
Also, real people don't get "retouching" because they aren't featured in magazines, hello.
    
I walk around with this unretouched face because I have to. Duh.
    
It's so riddled with dumb tone deaf errors!

It's like they went "ooh we got Emma Roberts to sign on to our brand! Yay let's use her even though that's a stupid move."
    
Jeff Berman:
:)
Okay. You don’t need to write a blog post. I’m just going to post this text exchange.
    
Erin Eby:
Ha. Maybe that's what we should do. It would be an interesting format for a blog. One people might want to read.
    
Jeff Berman:
I’m not kidding.
