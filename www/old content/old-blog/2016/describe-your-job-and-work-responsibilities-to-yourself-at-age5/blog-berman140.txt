    I would tell my 5-year-old self that as an account manager, you should always be nice, smile even when you're mad, and keep your promises.

    It's like I make my own puzzle. I figure out how things like letters and shapes look, then play with how the pieces will fit together.

    You know how you love to use new ideas to solve problems? Now you get to do that all day, every day. And you get to pick who you do it with.

    You get to use art as a tool to get people to feel and do things. Also, free M&Ms.
