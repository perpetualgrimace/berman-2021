## Why should anyone care?

Imagine this: You walk into a room full of people from your target audience. You notice most are talking with each other or looking at their phones. You have one chance to get their attention. What do you say?

### The first question you need to answer

It's not easy to change people's behavior and move them closer to your brand.
