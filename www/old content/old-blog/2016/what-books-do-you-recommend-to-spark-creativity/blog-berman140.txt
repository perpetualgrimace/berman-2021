    *The Elements of Style* beautifully illustrated by Maira Kalman. Creativity is endless with illustration. Also, anything by Pantone or Louise Fili.

    Amid the dreck, thereâ€™s so much good writing out there help find a rhythm. Leonard, Heller, DeLillo, Fitzgerald were all copywriters first.

    I recently received *Everybody Writes* by Ann Handley through a Twitter chat contest. Great book for social writing. Also, hilarious.

    Design in the digital era can suffer from a feedback loop so I use classic resources to reset, like *The Graphic Artist & His Design Problems*
