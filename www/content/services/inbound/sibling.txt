## How do you measure inaction?

You don't know what business you're not doing because your prospects can't find you, bounce off of your site, or just wander off never to be heard from again.

Inbound marketing is the second great digital marketing revolution, after everyone realized they needed a web site twenty years ago. 85% of marketers now say they're running an inbound marketing program. It's no surprise to hear those programs are generating measurably more leads than traditional marketing.

### Watch the needle move

The upside of digital tools is that marketers now have the power to measure the effects of everything they do online. The downside is that marketers bear the burden of accountability now more than ever.

A strategically grounded inbound program is a key component of the answer for the marketing manager charged with keeping prospects engaged and feeding hungry sales teams. Inbound marketing is quantifiable, scalable, iterative, and has proven return on investment.

Based on a solid (link: about/services/strategy text: strategic foundation), our work connects the deepest concerns of the audience with the core truth at the heart of the brand, delivering a stronger ROI.

### The human side of inbound marketing

It's a misconception that inbound marketing is about automation. On the contrary, it's an intensely human effort built upon close attention to our clients' prospects and analytics, so that we can create content that connects their business objectives and the core truth of their brands with the deepest concerns of their prospects and customers.
