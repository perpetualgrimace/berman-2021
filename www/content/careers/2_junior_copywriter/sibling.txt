Title: Junior Copywriter

----

Text: 

How do you persuade someone to think about something they’re trying to ignore, using only a mac and your imagination?

We need a writer who creates with audacity and edits just as boldly, who is curious and willing to step into unknown waters. We need a tone chameleon ready to work on anything from skateboards to finance to crackers to health care.

One note: To apply for this job, you must show us a portfolio of work. It should include examples of both headline writing and long-form copy. These need not have been produced; spec work is fine. But it is not enough to want to be a copywriter. You need to show us that you can do it.

Sound like you? Send your portfolio to (email: careers@bermancreative.com?subject=Junior Copywriter text: careers@bermancreative.com) today.
