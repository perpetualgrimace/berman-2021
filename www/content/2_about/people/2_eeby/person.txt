Erin has been honing her skills for an advertising career since interviewing an agency art director as a grade schooler. She came to Berman from Switzerland, where she worked at Young & Rubicam-Geneva and launched her own agency with Swiss and French partners.

Erin graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Texas, completing the rigorous Texas Creative Sequence. An accomplished dancer, she performed with a professional contemporary company in Lausanne, and now dances with the Cambridge Dance Company.

When she's not designing or dancing, she writes for the Boston Mom's Blog, and advises the women of Chi Omega at Tufts University.
