    We're in a cycle where strong creative work is seen as nice but not necessary. It's difficult to do, hard to measure, and not buzzworthy.

    I feel like marketing as a whole gets a bad rap. Good marketing is about connecting products to the people who would find them useful.

    Product placement in shows/movies. It's an unobtrusive way to advertise and honestly, it reflects the real world.

    Targeted video pre-roll. More exposure to your targeted demographic increases the likelihood that people will act & respond to your message.

    Guerrilla marketing. Although it can be risky, this low-cost strategy connects people to products in unexpected ways.
