Jake is the new kid in town, coming to Boston from upstate New York. If you had asked Jake when he was a kid if he wanted to grow up to be a copywriter, he would have said, “that sounds like it’s boring.” Oh, young Jake, you have so much to learn.

Jake graduated from Boston University's graduate program in advertising where he fell in love with creative advertising and the art of written persuasion. When he’s not sweating over his keyboard, he enjoys listening to music, watching comedies, and staying up late exploring the Internet.
