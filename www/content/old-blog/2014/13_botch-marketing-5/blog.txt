Hey, if it works for the #1 brand in the category, it will work for you, right?

Before deciding on a me-too marketing strategy, try this thought experiment: Consider a time when you were faced with a brand decision between the category leader and the copycat. How many times did you choose the copycat?

##The Difference Between Brand and Commodity##

Virtually every marketer who positions his brand as an acceptable alternative to a category leader is playing a losing game.

The me-too strategy works only when you can compete on price, such as store-brand alternatives to name-brand cosmetics. If you have the volume to produce at lower cost than the category leader and you’re willing to commoditize the category, feel free to disregard this post.

For everyone else, think about your message and design as tools to _distinguish_ your brand from others. The valuable brands are those whose users see them as different from competitors for good reasons.

##The Difference Between Operations and Marketing##

Operationally, it might make sense to play the copycat. Following in the footsteps of someone who has built an efficient organization can spare you from making your own costly mistakes.

But marketing works by different rules from operations. When your message mimics that of the category leader, you only remind your audience that the other guys are #1 and you’re not.

##Your Unique Message Already Exists##

Where does your distinct, ownable brand message come from? It comes from the very reason you’re in business. Read the next post for more.
