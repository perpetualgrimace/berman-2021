Subhead: Holiday Goodness in a Season of Junkfood

----

Text: Gifts are good, gifts are fun. Everyone likes getting something. But the real joy of the holidays comes from giving, so for 2014 we decided to make that easier while keeping the fun part.

We created (link: http://writesomethi.ng text: WriteSomethi.ng), a communally-written holiday story benefiting 826 Boston, a local charity who help under-resourced students with writing. Because they know, and we know, that being a better writer makes you a better anything.

People from anywhere could contribute to the story, and with every keystroke they put 2¢ into the hands of 826 Boston to provide one-on-one tutoring, workshops, publishing opportunities, supplies, and more to Boston students.
