Text:

Jess has a history of making things happen. A graduate of the College at Brockport, she dabbled in forensic pathology before deciding to study broadcast communications, in the process creating the position of Final Cut Pro Tutor to help other students.

Jessica cut her teeth on social media, brand research, and content creation at VH1 Digital before moving to Boston. She runs social marketing and video editing for us, wrangling things in motion. Jess grew up on an island above Niagara Falls and still roots for the Buffalo Bills, for some reason.
