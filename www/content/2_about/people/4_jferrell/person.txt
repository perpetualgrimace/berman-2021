>I’m good at teaching myself how to do stuff, which is good, because that’s the only way I learn anything.

James enjoys building things: websites, furniture, songs. Typically, we’ll ask James, “Is there a way to do this?” To which the answer is often, “Probably.” And sure enough, James figures out a way to do it.

He is a graduate of the USF Zimmerman Advertising program, and enjoys design because he likes making things easy for people to use and understand. He’s also a serious musician and sound engineer, touring one semester with a screamo band, much to his parents’ dismay. But we won't talk about that.
