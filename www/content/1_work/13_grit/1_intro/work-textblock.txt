ChildObesity180 came to us with one of the biggest challenges we’ve ever faced: How to get kids to choose water over soda, activity over video games, and fruits and veggies over salty snacks.

It isn’t easy getting kids to give up something fun and easy for something worth more later. So we decided to tell the truth: Making the right decision is hard. It takes GRIT.

We created a web-based campaign designed to reward kids for making tough choices. The idea is that small decisions pay off in the long run by enabling kids to reach their own personal goals. Messaging was targeted to both kids and to their role models: the adults who work with them in the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4H, and Pop Warner Football.
