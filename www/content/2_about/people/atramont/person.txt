Amanda is a self-proclaimed crazy cat lady, despite only owning one cat. She was born and raised in Miami and is working on adjusting to the cold, although she's lived in New England for 10 years now. Prior to joining the Berman team, she worked in finance, radio and digital ad sales and education.

Amanda graduated from Trinity College with a dual degree in Political Science and Spanish. She was a four-year member of the women's tennis team, and captain her senior year. She has a master's degree in journalism from Boston University.  

When she isn't in the office, Amanda cooks, works out, travels, reads, and volunteers through the Junior League of Boston, although usually not all at once.
