Subhead: Holiday Goodness in a Season of Junkfood

----

Text: Gifts are good, gifts are fun. Everyone likes getting something. But the real joy of the holidays comes from giving, so for 2014 we decided to make that easier while keeping the fun part.

We created (link: http://writesomething.org text: WriteSomething), a communally-written holiday story benefiting (link: http://www.826boston.org text: 826 Boston), a local charity who help under-resourced students with writing. Because they know, and we know, that being a better writer makes you a better anything.
