## Why would you still do print?

Digital and (link: about/services/inbound text: inbound marketing) tools offer unprecedented power to measure, analyze, and continually improve your marketing efforts. So why bother with things like brochures or catalogs or anything printed anymore?

### People still like things printed on paper

A funny thing happened on the way to the digital revolution. Print didn't die.

To give one example, 8% more printed books were bought in the U.S. in 2013 than in 2011. And take a guess how many that is? More than 2.5 billion books in 2013 alone. That's more than eight actual books, printed on paper, purchased that year for every single man, woman, and child in the U.S.

### Print as a marketing medium

Okay, so people still like books. Fine. What does print offer you as a marketer?

#### Print is persistent
Where even the best web sites disappear with a click, print sticks around. A nicely printed, well designed piece with a relevant message has an excellent chance to be saved, which means it can be discovered again and deliver its message again to your prospect. 48% of people say they hold onto print materials for future reference.

#### It's portable
Print has the unique ability to go almost anywhere and deliver an instant message, with next to no effort required from your target audience. We can help you decide how much content is best to deliver to your audience at each stage in the sales cycle.

#### It's targeted
Print can be as widely or as narrowly targeted as you like. Do you have multiple audiences with different needs? Terrific. Identify the venues where your brand comes into contact with each, and create a targeted, printed piece that offers your brand as the solution to their specific problem at that moment.

#### Print is a force multiplier
Adding print to your marketing mix makes your online efforts more effective. 70% of Americans say they prefer reading printed pieces than reading on a screen, even when they do both. You want to see your web site convert more traffic? Put a brochure with a supporting message into the hands of your best prospects.
