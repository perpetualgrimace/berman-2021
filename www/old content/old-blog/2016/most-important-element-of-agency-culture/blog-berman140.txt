    Integrity. In your actions, in your words, in your work, and in your commitment to your teammates.

    Time to bond. You spend a lot of time with your coworkers, so get to know them on many levels in order to create the best work together.

    A sense of teamwork. When projects are created with many perspectives, it's exciting to see how they develop in unexpected ways.
