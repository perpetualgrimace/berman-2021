Slide1: 

## Strategy##

Everything we do begins with your business objectives. Our (link: about/services/strategy text: Strategic Platform) outlines how to use marketing to achieve business objectives, based upon two fundamental questions: "What are the core truths of your brand?" and "What does the world look like to your prospects?" The answers map the path for the creative work to follow.

## Assessment#

Once a message is out in the world, we can learn from it. How are we doing? What is the reaction? What can we see from afar that we couldn't see up close? How can we make it better?

Slide5: 

## Re-engineering##

A key to long-term marketing success is ensuring that the strategy and message never stagnate. As we measure performance, as the market and culture change, we adjust course to keep the message current and compelling.
