## Put it in motion

Things that move are more compelling than things that don't. And while not everything you have to communicate is best done with video, it's worth noting the average internet user spends 88% more time on a website that has video than one without.

### While they're in motion

That 85% of Americans on the internet watch videos isn't surprising. But it's worth noting that 75% watch videos on their phones. Video travels.

### Make them watch

Just because a video can be viewed anywhere doesn't mean it will be. Creating something engaging and relevant to your audience matters as much with video as with online or print or any other media. Be clear on who you're trying to influence, what they care about, and what you want them to take away, before you get busy shooting and editing.

### Make it worth sharing

92% of mobile video viewers share videos with others. Make something compelling to your audience and watch it extend your reach organically.

### Give them a next step

Make it easy for viewers to buy what you're selling, find out more, share what they just saw.
