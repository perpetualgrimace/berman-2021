## About Jeff Berman

As far as we know, Jeff is the only creative director who studied astrophysics. After discovering what astrophysicists actually do, Jeff left the University of Chicago for an advertising job at Leo Burnett Company. Jeff worked at Ogilvy & Mather (New York) and Mullen (Boston) in a variety of account management and strategy jobs,  created Shankbone (Fine Apparel for Degenerates) and got it into Bloomingdale's and 100 surf shops, before starting Berman Creative in 2002.
