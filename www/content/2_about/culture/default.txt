## There are always four variables

- How good is the solution
- How much it costs
- How long it takes
- How miserable is everyone going to be through the process

Historically, most of work life involves sacrificing on at least one of the above. We think you shouldn't have to. Over the past 13+ years, we've developed a process to quickly get to a shared understanding that forms the foundation for good work. We then work to deliver a solution that's better than good, quickly, efficiently, and with pleasure.

### What we mean by Applied Empathy

We listen to our clients with big ears to understand their needs. We work to understand our clients' customers and prospects so our work will strike a chord and persuade people to change their thinking. And talented (link: about/people text: people) like working in a place where people look out for each other.

## This place is built on three principles:

### Integrity
The secret ingredient to effective communication is truth. Our process works to discover and reveal the hidden, core truth of the brand. Truth is magic.

And this carries over into the day-to-day. Our clients trust us with the public face of their brands. We need to earn that trust with everything we do. There are no shortcuts to responsibility.

### Ability
We are the best at what we do. Everyone at Berman is both talented and committed to continually honing their skills. From strategy to design to copywriting to art direction to production, we owe it to our clients to be as good as we can be at each discipline.

### Spirit
You've got to love it. What we do is often fun, but it ain't easy. The good work comes when we combine a deep insight into a problem with the joy of discovery. Often, the most powerful component of our work is the implicit pleasure that shines through as we create it.

## Beyond our walls
