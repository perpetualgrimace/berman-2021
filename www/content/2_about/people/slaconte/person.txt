Stephen studied playwriting and acting at New York University, and has since been on a quest to prove he's useful. After some years spent writing in Los Angeles he returned home to Boston so he could experience seasons again. He only misses the kale.

Stephen has a passion for putting voices to brands, and an obsessive eye for consistency. When he's not copywriting, Stephen makes funny things that go on the internet. He hopes to one day make a calendar of dogs wearing seasonal bandanas.
