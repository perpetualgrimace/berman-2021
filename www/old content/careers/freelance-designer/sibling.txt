Title: Freelance Designer

----

Text: 

We are on the hunt for a freelance graphic designer with proven expertise in identity design. Must be equal parts conceptual and executional, able to stretch out in different directions, create a beautiful, diverse set of identities for consideration, and fully develop the graphic universe that falls out of a chosen design route. Must have an open mind, thick skin, and a team-focused attitude to work with and learn from (link: http://bermancreative.com/about/people text: these guys). We're looking for someone who knows how to design hot and edit cold, creating systematic graphic rules only after you've explored where the edges are.

Ready for a challenge? (email: careers@bermancreative.com?subject=Freelance Designer text: Apply today)  by sending us two things:

1. A concise and persuasive cover letter, calling out three identities you feel represent your best work and why

2. Your design portfolio

Incomplete applications will not be considered. We look forward to hearing from you.
